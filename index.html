                    I am Cheryl Kong. I am currently ecnrolling in CIT program in BCIT. I have been in Canada for two
                    years. My
                    home country is Malaysia.
                    <strong>Important: </strong> Malaysians <em>are <b>not </b></em>Malays. Malaysia is a multiethnic
                    and multicultural country.
                    About half the population is ethnically Malay, with the minorities of Chinese, Indians, and
                    indigenous peoples. Besides, I enjoy
                    playing piano and guitar during free time. My goal is to get a cybersecurity job in the future.
