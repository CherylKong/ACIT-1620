    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my personal website! </h1>
    <h2>My introduction</h2>

    <p>
        I am Cheryl Kong. I am currently taking CIT program in BCIT. I have been in Canada for two years. My home country is Malaysia.
        <strong>Important: </strong> Malaysians <em>are <b>not </b></em>Malays. Malaysia is a multiethnic and multicultural country. 
        About half the population is ethnically Malay, with the minorities of Chinese, Indians, and indigenous peoples.
